# backtrack: turn-based-rpg

# Preproposal
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project? It should have turn-based fighting with different skills against different enemies or a simple farming game to relax
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?  Fiona Irawan
## Do you have any questions of your own?: Do we have to make sure it won't be copyrighted in some way, and make everything ourselves?
